# Getting Started

## What to do?

In this project you have unit tests and incomplete functions. Your job is to **re-write these functions** so that the
 testing pipeline in GitHub passes. Once your **commit passes** all the tests, **show it to someone responsible** for this 
 part of the triathlon (most likely Peter), and **you're done**!

## Where to see test results?

On the main page for the repository, click on the tab `Actions`. There you can see if a commit has failed (marked with an X),
or passed (marked with a âœ“).

Testing locally before committing is a lot faster, though.

## Rules
 - No cheating - this means you can only make changes to the file located in `src.main.java.concise.triathlon`
 - Googling is allowed - you can use anything you find on the Internet
 - Have fun

## For running tests locally

Run command `gradle test`
